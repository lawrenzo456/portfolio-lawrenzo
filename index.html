            Check out this text adventure game, developed with Kevin Ortiz for
            Futurecode. Our goal was to build a text based adventure game that
            started off innocuously, then progressed to more intense scenes,
            peaking at an apocalyptic scenario. The code utilizes a series of
            arrays inside of an object to efficiently pull statements based on
            player decisions.

          </a>
          <p>
            In this project, I collaborated with Laynie Buten, Haroon Salimi,
            and Rene Ledesma to create a single-player, Family Feud like game in
            order to provide people with an variable alternative to Solitaire.
            This game is browser based and will prompt the user to answer a
            series of questions. Then, the game will compare the guess to the
            answers and assign a respective score that will carry over through
            rounds. If the player reaches a certain threshold of points by the
            end of the third round, they will enter a "fast money" round.
            Finally, they will be prompted whether they would like to replay the
            game.

          <p>
            I created this Chrome extension in partnership with Stormi ___ as
            part of Future Code 2's Fall Hackathon. The initial goal of this
            extension was to create a research focused tool that allows people
            to get information about something they're curious about while
            perusing the internet without needing to open another tab. However,
            due to API constraints, we reduced the scope of the program to
            instead be able to search a nutrition API for various ingredients.
            Users who are interested in accessing various food information,
            including sugars, proteins, and carbohydrates, are able to do so
            without leaving a recipe page, for example. This code involves DOM
            manipulation by using Javascript to create and call various events,
            which then will send the user input to the nutrition server with an
            API call. Then, the nutritional information from that server will be
            printed to the extension.
